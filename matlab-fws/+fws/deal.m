%% INPUTS:
%         x - x and y are the coordinates of the center of the circle
%         y - coordinates of the center of the circle
%         r - r is the radius of the circle
%         step - 0.01 is the angle step, bigger values will draw the circle faster but
%         you might notice imperfections (not very smooth)
